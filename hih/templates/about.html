<h5> Welcome to Hand in Hand, an online platform that ensures the patient-therapist relationship continues outside the office.
<br>
We believe that in order to facilitate proper therapy, this relationship needs to be continuous instead of today's episodic nature.
<br>
Hand in Hand is built with love by Cameron Brennan, Jason Deitz and Aakaash Meduri.
