# Hand in Hand
## Therapy for the digital world

Welcome to **Hand in Hand**, an online platform that ensures the patient-therapist relationship continues outside the office. We believe that in order to facilitate proper therapy, this relationship needs to be continuous instead of today's episodic nature.
